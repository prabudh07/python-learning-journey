--------------------------------------------> Funcionality
This program's functionality is to interact with the user by asking for their first and last names using the input() function. It takes these inputs as strings, combines them with a space in between to form the full name, and then prints a personalized greeting message that includes the full name using the print() function.

In short, it collects user input, processes it by joining two strings, and outputs a customized welcome message.
