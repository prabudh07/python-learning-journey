----------------------------> Functionality

This Python program asks the user to enter a number and then checks whether the number is even or odd. It uses the modulo operator % to find the remainder when the number is divided by 2. If the remainder is 0, the number is even, and the program prints a message stating that the number is even. If the remainder is not 0, the number is odd, and the program prints a message stating that the number is odd. This is a simple example of using conditional statements and arithmetic operations to make decisions in Python.
