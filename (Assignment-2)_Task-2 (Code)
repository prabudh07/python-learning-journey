------------------------------------------------------------> Functionality
This program calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50 using a for loop:

It first creates a variable "total_sum" initialized to 0. This variable acts as an accumulator to keep track of the running total.

The for loop iterates through each number between 1 and 50 (both inclusive).

Inside the loop, each number is added to total_sum, updating the accumulated sum as the loop progresses.

After the loop completes, it prints the final value of total_sum, which is the sum of all numbers from 1 to 50.
