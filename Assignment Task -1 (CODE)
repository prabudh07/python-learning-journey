---------------> Functionality of the Code
This Python code takes two numbers as input from the user, then performs and displays the results of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on those numbers.

The code uses the input() function to prompt the user to enter two numbers.
Each input is converted from a string to an integer using int() to allow mathematical operations.

Four arithmetic operations are performed:

Addition (n1 + n2)

Subtraction (n1 - n2)

Multiplication (n1 * n2)

Division (n1 / n2)

The print() function displays the results of each operation in the console.

Example Output
If the user enters n1= 5 and n2=10:

Addition: 15

Subtraction: -5

Multiplication: 50

Division:0.5
